# VISSR feeder template version 4

This version supports multiple feeders to be used together with the server / state storage.
The server exposes  a feede registration interface over UDS using the sock file "/var/tmp/vissv2/feederReg.sock".
The feeder reads by default the file "feederConfig.json" at startup and uses the information in it to register with the server.
It is possible to configure a different file to be read by the CLI parameter "-c <filename>".
This can be used when starting multiple feeders.

A feeder registers by issuing the following request:
```
Reg-request:{"action": "reg", "name": "xxxx"}
```
If successful the server rsponds with
```
Reg-response:{"action": "reg"", "name": "xxxx", "sockfile": "/x/y/z.sock"}
```
where the sockfile shall be used by the feeder to set up a UDS server listening to requests from the server.
The communication over this UDS channel is identical to the server-feederv3 communication.

A feeder can also at any point de-register with the server by issung the request:
```
Dereg-request:{"action": "dereg", "name": "xxxx"}
```
which if successful get the following response:
```
Dereg-response:{"action": "dereg", "name": "xxxx"}
```
Non-successful requests gets the following error response from the server:
```
Error-response:{"action": "error"}
```
The server does not hold information on which Set request shall be sent to which feeder that is responsible for forwarding it to the underlying vehicle system.
It therefore sends the request to all registered feeders, and then it is the responsibility of the feeders to evaluate which Set requests it shall act on, or just drop.

The current logic used by the feederv4 supports any tree/branch to be defined as the feeder scope,
but it does not support the exclusion of parts of the tree/branch.
This will be added at some later point.

The runstack.sh bash script is updated to support registration of or or two feeders.
The case wih two feeders is showing a scenario where a truck has Vehicle and Trailer1 trees and a corresponding Vehicle and Trailer1 feeders.
